    "### Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "The red wine industry shows a recent exponential growth as social drinking is on the rise. Nowadays, industry players are using product quality certifications to promote their products. This is a time-consuming process and requires the assessment given by human experts, which makes this process very expensive. Also, the price of red wine depends on a rather abstract concept of wine appreciation by wine tasters, opinion among whom may have a high degree of variability. Another vital factor in red wine certification and quality assessment is physicochemical tests, which are laboratory-based and consider factors like acidity, pH level, sugar, and other chemical properties. The red wine market would be of interest if the human quality of tasting can be related to wine’s chemical properties so that certification and quality assessment and assurance processes are more controlled. This project aims to determine which features are the best quality red wine indicators and generate insights into each of these factors to our model’s red wine quality."

    "\n",
    "**Q1. What is the analytical approach that you would take for this project? Why do you think it's the right approach?**\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we will use a **predictive modeling approach** using supervised machine learning, specifically **regression analysis**. Since our goal is to predict the quality of red wine based on various physicochemical properties, regression is the appropriate choice as it allows us to model the relationship between independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (wine quality).\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach involves:\n",
    "- Exploring and cleaning the dataset.\n",
    "- Selecting relevant features based on correlation analysis.\n",
    "- Implementing two regression models (e.g., Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression) to compare performance.\n",
    "- Evaluating models using R², RMSE, and MAE.\n",
    "- Determining the most important features affecting wine quality.\n",

    "- **Quality ratings** as the target variable (rated on a scale from 0 to 10).\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features expected to impact quality:\n",
    "- **Alcohol content**: Higher alcohol levels often correlate with better quality.\n",
    "- **pH and acidity**: Balanced acidity is essential for wine taste.\n",
    "- **Sulfur dioxide levels**: Helps preserve wine but excessive amounts can impact taste.\n",
